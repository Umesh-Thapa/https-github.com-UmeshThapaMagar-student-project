LEARNING DIARY, < Front End > MODULE


Day 1
Today, I began my front-end project by setting up a basic structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created the three core files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) and opened everything in VS Code. It felt great to start something visual â€” being able to see what Iâ€™m building as I code really motivates me.
I focused on getting the layout right and added a simple header, sections, and buttons. I also linked the CSS and JS files properly. This reminded me how important file structure and clean naming are in real-world projects.

Day 2
I decided to start using Git for version control. I used Git GUI since itâ€™s more visual and easier to follow than the command line for me. I created my first local repository and committed my initial files. It was a bit confusing at first (especially the difference between staging and committing), but once I got the hang of it, it made a lot of sense.
This was also the day I learned the power of version tracking â€” I could now roll back or experiment freely without fear of losing progress.

Day 3
Today was a bit of a rollercoaster. I tried pushing my project to GitHub for the first time. I ran into several issues adding the remote â€” mainly because of a small mistake in the repository URL (I had a line break without realizing it). I kept getting errors like remote helper 'https' aborted session, and at one point, even removed and re-added the .git folder completely.
But I didnâ€™t give up. I took a step back, read the error carefully, and re-pasted the GitHub URL via Notepad to avoid formatting issues. It finally worked. I pushed everything successfully and even enabled GitHub Pages to view my site live. Seeing the project online felt really rewarding.

Day 4
I added some final touches today â€” a mobile menu with a toggle button and an FAQ section using a JavaScript accordion. It was nice to see the site become interactive, not just static. I used Flexbox and Grid to make the layout responsive and tested it on different screen sizes.
This part helped me think like a real developer â€” balancing design, layout, and interactivity. Itâ€™s also where I got to apply real logic with JavaScript instead of just styling things. Iâ€™m more comfortable now using querySelector, event listeners, and modifying element styles dynamically.

Reflection
This module gave me a full journey through front-end development â€” from writing raw HTML and CSS to deploying a fully functional webpage on GitHub Pages. More than the tools themselves, I learned how to solve real problems: debugging Git errors, organizing files, designing layouts, and making a website feel alive.
I'm proud of the project and the process. It's a solid start to my portfolio and my growth as a developer.
